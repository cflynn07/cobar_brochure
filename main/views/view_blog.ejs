     		<h3> Testing business continuity plans can be a major challenge to many organizations. They require management support, time for preparation and execution, funding, careful planning and a structured process from pre-test through test and post-test evaluation.
     		<br />
     		<br />
     		Here are some exaples of common business continuity tests:
     		<br />
			<li>Testing the alert and notification procedures;  including instructions for relocation to alternate sites, with and without warning and during work and non-work hours.</li>  
			<li>Testing the logistical support, services, and infrastructure systems (e.g. water, electrical power, heating, and air conditioning) at the alternate site.  </li> 
			<li>Testing the interoperable communications and information systems. </li> 
			<li>Testing an organizations ability to access vital records, systems, and databases necessary to perform essential functions.</li>
			<li>Testing an employees ability to work from home.</li>
			<br />
			The challenge of planning such tests can be drastically reduced by using a management system like Themis that provides structure and automates distribution, collection and aggregation of test information.
