      <p><h4>
       		 Testing business continuity plans can be a major challenge for many organizations. They require management support, time for preparation and execution, funding, careful planning and a structured process from pre-test through test and post-test evaluation. The challenge of planning such tests can be drastically through management systems like Themis that provide structure and automate distribution, collection and aggregation of testing data.
